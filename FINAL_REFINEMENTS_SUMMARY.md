# Final Website Refinements - Summary

## Date: 2025-01-08

## Changes Completed

### 1. **Desktop Display Fix**
- **Issue**: White text was visible on mobile but not on desktop computers
- **Root Cause**: CSS only had color declarations in dark mode media query, not in default (light) mode
- **Fix**: Added explicit black color declarations for all text elements in default state:
  ```css
  body, p, li, td, th, div, span, strong, em, a {
    color: #000000 !important;
  }
  ```
- **File Modified**: `assets/css/custom.css`

### 2. **Simplified Dropdown UI**
- **Issue**: Collapsible sections had bulky boxes with +/- symbols
- **Goal**: Minimalist, clean design
- **Changes**:
  - Removed background colors (#f8f9fa)
  - Changed from bulky borders to thin bottom border only
  - Replaced +/- symbols with ▼ arrow that rotates 180° when open
  - Reduced padding from 18px to 12px

- **Approach**: Focused on research capabilities and methods, avoiding duplication of CV publication lists
- **Navigation Updated**: Changed from `/publications/` to `/research/`

### 5. **Footer Credits Updated**
- **Old Format**: "Powered by Jekyll & AcademicPages. Website by Zhonghao"
- **New Format**: "Powered by Zhonghao → Jekyll → Academic Pages"
- **Change**: More prominent credit to website developer, cleaner arrow-based flow
- **File Modified**: `_includes/footer.html`

### 6. **Removed "Follow Feed" Button**
- **Action**: Removed RSS feed button from footer social links
- **Reason**: Simplify UI, not commonly used
