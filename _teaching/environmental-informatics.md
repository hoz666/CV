Interdisciplinary course exploring the integration of information technology, environmental science, and engineering for sustainable urban water management. Students learn to develop and apply environmental informatics tools.

**Course Objectives:**
* Understanding environmental data collection and processing
* Application of GIS and remote sensing to water resources
* Hydrological modeling and simulation
* Low impact development (LID) design principles
* Climate change adaptation in urban water systems

**Teaching Methods:**
* Case studies from Canadian cities
* Hands-on software training (GIS, hydrological models)
* Field data collection and analysis
* Collaborative research projects

This course reflects Dr. Valeo's research expertise in applying computational tools and field technologies to solve urban water challenges.
