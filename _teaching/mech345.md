[Course Information on UVic Website](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2020011/MECH345)

## Course Description

This course provides students with fundamental understanding of fluid mechanics principles and their applications to engineering systems. Topics include fluid properties, flow kinematics and dynamics, conservation principles, pipe flow, boundary layers, and dimensional analysis.

**Prerequisites:** MECH 220, MATH 200, and MECH 240 or MECH 295

## Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

1. **Flow Analysis**: Articulate the broad range of situations in nature and technology which involve fluid mechanics, and explain basic flow analysis techniques used for investigation and design

2. **Flow Classifications**: Demonstrate understanding of flow classifications (steady/unsteady, internal/external, laminar/turbulent, 1D/2D/3D) and appropriately apply these classifications with approximations such as continuum flow, inviscid flow, incompressible flow

3. **Mathematical Tools**: Apply concepts of vector fields (velocity, force, acceleration), scalar fields (pressure, density, temperature), and vector calculus to engineering analysis of fluid systems

4. **Conservation Principles**: Properly apply system and control volume methods based on conservation of mass, momentum, and energy to the analysis and design of engineering fluid systems

5. **Hydrostatics**: Apply fluid statics to fluids at rest or Newton's Second Law to fluids in rigid body motion, using calculus to determine pressure variation, forces and moments on submerged surfaces, buoyancy and stability of floating bodies

6. **Internal Flows**: Apply mass, momentum, and energy conservation to steady internal (pipe) flows, interpret laminar and turbulent flow models, and estimate head loss and power requirements in piping systems

7. **Boundary Layers**: Apply integral methods and empirical models to analyze boundary layer flows and evaluate drag on bodies in fluid flow

8. **Dimensional Analysis**: Apply principles of dimensional homogeneity to engineering analysis, and use dimensional analysis and similitude for compact data representation, design of experiments, and classification of flow regimes using dimensionless parameters

## Course Topics

- **Fluid Properties**: Physical properties and their consequences on fluid flow (Mach and Reynolds numbers)
- **Conservation Principles**: Mass, momentum, and energy conservation for fluid flow
- **Hydrostatics**: Pressure distribution, forces on submerged surfaces, buoyancy, stability
- **Flow Kinematics**: Velocity fields, streamlines, pathlines, acceleration
- **Control Volume Analysis**: Application to engineering systems
- **Pipe Flow**: Laminar and turbulent flow in pipes, head loss calculations
- **Boundary Layers**: Drag on bodies, flow separation
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Similitude and dimensionless parameters

## Laboratory Experiments

**Four mandatory laboratory experiments** (16% of final grade):

1. **Linear Momentum Experiment**: Application of momentum conservation principles
2. **Energy Equation in Venturi Flow**: Bernoulli's equation and flow measurement
3. **Friction in Laminar and Turbulent Pipe Flow**: Reynolds number effects and friction factors
4. **Friction in Airflow**: Drag measurements and boundary layer analysis

**Note:** Attendance and completion of all laboratory experiments are compulsory. Failure to complete all laboratory requirements will result in a grade of N.
