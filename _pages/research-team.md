## Current Graduate Students

**Farzam A.** - PhD student  
Developing numerical circulation models for stormwater ponds storing water for potential reuse. The models will provide predictions on the distribution of contaminants in the ponds both spatially and temporally as a function of climate and fluid dynamics. This work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. He (UofC), Dr. Neumann (UofA) and Dr. Checkley (UofC).

**Hauke B.** - PhD student  
Developing fuzzy mathematical expressions for oil spill extent in marine environments using drifter data and numerical circulation models. This work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Charles Hannah (co-supervisor) of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

**Aditya R.** - PhD student  
Researching the long term impacts of flooding on transportation systems. He is part of the University of Calgary's IISC CREATE Program and co-supervised with Dr. He.

**Jessica D.** - Master's student  
Researching bioretention of heavy metals and evapotranspiration in bioretention cells.

**Sarah Q.** - Master's student  
Co-supervised with Dr. Phalguni Mukhopadhaya, Sarah is evaluating instruments for thermal heat transfer monitoring in walls.

**Fatima T.** - Master's student  
Working on hydraulic models of treatment ponds in series for treating polluted runoff.
