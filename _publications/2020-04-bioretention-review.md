This comprehensive review synthesizes research on bioretention systems, one of the most effective low-impact development (LID) practices for urban stormwater management. The paper examines how different growing media compositions, plant species, and their synergistic interactions affect the removal of various contaminants including heavy metals, nutrients, and pathogens.

**Key Findings:**
- Critical analysis of media selection for optimal contaminant removal
- Plant species effects on system hydraulic and treatment performance
- Mechanisms of plant-media-microbe interactions
- Design recommendations for cold climate applications
- Knowledge gaps and future research directions

**Impact:** This review has become a go-to reference for practitioners designing bioretention systems, with extensive citations in both research literature and design guidelines. The paper's emphasis on cold climate considerations is particularly valuable for Canadian and northern applications.
