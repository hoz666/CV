This paper presents an innovative computer vision approach for assessing the infiltration capacity of permeable pavements. Traditional testing methods are time-consuming and require specialized equipment. The proposed digital imaging method enables rapid, non-destructive evaluation of pavement performance, making it practical for routine maintenance inspections.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel image processing algorithm for infiltration measurement
- Field validation across multiple pavement types
- Practical tool for municipal maintenance programs
- Cost-effective alternative to conventional testing

**Significance:** This method has been adopted by several Canadian municipalities for pavement condition assessment programs.
