This editorial introduces a Special Issue addressing one of the most pressing challenges in water resources: understanding and managing the combined impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on hydrological systems. As cities expand and weather patterns shift, traditional stormwater management approaches often prove inadequate.

**Major Topics Covered in the Special Issue:**
- Urban flood risk under climate change scenarios
- Performance of green infrastructure in extreme weather
- Integrated modeling approaches for urban hydrology
- Adaptation strategies for resilient cities
- Role of nature-based solutions

**Significance:** This Special Issue brought together international researchers to advance knowledge on sustainable urban water management in an era of environmental change. The editorial highlights critical research gaps and outlines priorities for future work in urban hydrology.

**Relevance:** The insights from this work directly inform the design of resilient urban water systems and have implications for policy-makers, urban planners, and engineers worldwide.
