This paper describes the development and testing of a novel velocity measurement device designed for large water bodies such as stormwater retention ponds. Understanding flow patterns is critical for predicting the distribution of contaminants and designing effective treatment systems.

**Innovation:**
- Custom-designed sensor array for 3D velocity measurement
- Robust performance in field conditions
- Integration with CFD models for enhanced prediction
- Application to stormwater pond design optimization

**Applications:** The device supports research on bacterial contamination transport, sediment distribution, and thermal stratification in urban water bodies.

**Collaborators:** University of Calgary, University of Alberta
